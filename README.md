## Technologies
Just in case you care, we use mostly `C#/.NET` for our development but sometimes it comes to `HTML`, `CSS` and others...

## Projects
We curently work on a specific project [Personal Portfolio](https://github.com/orgs/musakai-cs/projects/3). We also build learning path of C#. This small project is mainly connected to [Pexiyk](https://github.com/Pexiyk) who wants to learn C# and he also writes his own learning path so anyone can learn the very basics. 

## Future plans
We would like to develop Personal portfolio. 
Next plan is to create a Discord bot that will communicate with the API of the website.
